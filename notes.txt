What do we want to get from the data? 

type in a city, get the current conditions


if you type in something that doesn't match exactly, i want to still be able to find it. 

ex. london, england -> still gets london
london: 
london
london,england

"url("http://localhost:8080/34c81de56ca1c3bfea9e.png")"

function toCSSURL(url){
    return `url(${url})`;
}

'url("http://localhost:8080/34c81de56ca1c3bfea9e.png")'



Things to Fix: 

-sizing on the background image
-new positions and design on the results
